# Day 38 Assignment

- this assignment is a simple app allowing users to "vote" for what bands they would like to see play at a venue
- it first requires the user to sign up with a new username and password, or log in if they already have an account
- the links at the head of the page navigate between the list of bands already voted for and a search page
- on the search page, there is a search bar with input and a button
- upon submitting a search term, the program searches the Spotify api for bands matching by name
- the user can then press a vote button on any result to add it to the voted collections
- any voted-for bands will then appear on the voted page
